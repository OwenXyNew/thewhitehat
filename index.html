            <h1>The White Haet</h1>
            <h2>Reasons why I should get the hat</h2>
            <p>So, everyone knows about your famous white hat. I said I would write a 5-page essay, but I decided against it and made a website instead. I'm using HTML code from what I learned from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a> which I have been enjoying. I like making things harder on myself for no reason, so let's get started!</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <ol>
                <li>It protects your eyes:
                    <p>The sun can make it hard to see, and it can harm your eyes. Also, the hat will protect you from sunburns! (Not that I have to worry about that.)</p>
                </li>
                <li>It's stylish:
                    <p>Your hat has style. There's no question about it. It looks awesome.</p>
                </li>
                <li>I'm broke:
                    <p>I would buy my own, but you know I don't have that money. You have a job you mostly enjoy, you get to teach a whole bunch of crazy kids while I get to have them as friends. How I earn money is by doing extra chores. I don't have time for that, I have <strong>schoolwork</strong>, so I have to do that instead of earning money.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Everyone wants a student to have it:
                    <p>Every MMS student wants your hat. It is iconic, <strong>even if</strong> they don't have you as a teacher, they like you.</p>
                </li>
                <li>I put in hard work:
                    <p>Making this website was lots of hard work. Even if you say no I will still be proud of this work. But please just say yes so this work doesn't go into the drain.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1>Extra Info</h1>
                <p>Okay I know this isn't a 5 page essay but I'm trying my best. I know you will most likely say no but making this website was fun and at least I can say I tried. I represent not just myself, not just my grade, but the entire middle school. Thank you for reading.</p>
