  <h1>The White Hat</h1>
  <h2>I Need the Hat</h2>
  <p>So, everyone knows about your famous white hat. I said I would write a 5 page essay. But I decided aganist it, I decided to make a website. Which is way harder. I'm using html code from what I learned from <a href="freecodecamp">freeCodeCamp</a> which I have been enjoying. I like making things harder on me for no reason so lets get started!</p>

    <li>It protects your eyes:<p> The sun can make it hard to see and it can harm your eyes. Also the hat will protect you from sunburns! (not that I have to worry about that)</p></li>
    <li>It's stylish:<p>Look your hat has style. There's no question about it. It looks awesome.</p></li>
    <li>I'm broke:<p>I would buy my own but you know I don't have that money. You have a job you mostly enjoy, you get to teach a whole bunch of crazy kids while I get to have them as friends. How I earn money is by doing extra chores, I don't have time for that, I have <strong>schoolwork</strong> so I have to do that instead of earning money.</p></li>
    <li>Everyone wants a student to have it:<p>Every MMS student wants your hat. It is iconic, <strong>even if</strong> they don't have you as a teacher they like you.</p></li>
